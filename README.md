## About this Project:
The current situtation with the pandemic highlighted the need to trace contacts of suspected Covid Positive patients so that the spread of virus within a community is contained. 

Hence for our Mobile Application Development course, we decided to build a contact tracing application for ***Android*** users.

This application notifies any person who may have come within 5 meters to a suspected covid patient

This application uses **Google's firebase platform** and the user locations are anonymously stored in **Google FireStore database**.
